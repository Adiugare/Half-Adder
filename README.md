# Half-Adder
It performs the addition of two single-bit binary numbers. The output consists of two values: Sum and Carry. The Sum is calculated using the XOR (exclusive OR) logic gate, while the Carry is generated using the AND gate. It's called a "half" adder because it doesn't account for carry inputs from previous additions, unlike a full adder.
