A half adder is a simple combinational circuit used to add two single-bit binary numbers. It has:

Two inputs: A and B (the two bits to be added).

Two outputs: Sum (S) and Carry (C).

The logic behind it is:

Sum (S): Calculated using the XOR (exclusive OR) gate: 
𝑆=𝐴⊕𝐵

Carry (C): Calculated using the AND gate: 
𝐶=𝐴⋅𝐵
